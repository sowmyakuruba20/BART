This folder contains the necessary code for the backend of the BART calculator application. Here, you will find the time and fare datasets, along with a Python backend code file that creates a graph database. Additionally, this code file inserts values into the database using the provided datasets.

The primary purpose of this rbackend folder is to provide the core logic for calculating both travel time and fare between any two BART stations. By leveraging the graph database and the datasets, this backend code enables efficient calculations and accurate results.

Feel free to explore the code and datasets to gain insights into the inner workings of the BART calculator application.
